This applies to webpages and documentation, too; if you have found a documentation “bug”, you should supply replacement text and which pages it should go on.\n\nRemember, there are many other users that are not experiencing your problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it while reading the documentation and searching the Web (you did do that before complaining, didn't you?). This means that very probably it is you who are doing something wrong, not the software.\n\nThe people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work as well as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be impugning their competence, which may offend some of them even if you are correct. It's especially undiplomatic to yell “bug” in the Subject line.\n\nWhen asking your question, it is best to write as though you assume you are doing something wrong, even if you are privately pretty sure you have found an actual bug. If there really is a bug, you will hear about it in the answer.

But you can change this so that either column only shows one tiddler at a time.\n\n*Advantage:  this allows you to keep one column 'locked' into place with one fixed tiddler, while the other column can have multiple tiddlers accessible by scrolling up and down.\n*Disadvantage: any other tiddlers in the 'locked' column will be hidden. You will need to open them with the links in the 'Open' tab in the sidebar.\n\nTo try this out, open the sidebar tab with the gear icon (<<icon {{$:/core/images/options-button}} \"\">>), and choose from the dropdown menus there.\n\n!Disable autocomplete\n\nAs I mentioned, unfortunately the autocomplete plugin (called the edit-comptext plugin) does not work in iOS and other contexts where one can't use the down arrow key.\n\nTo disable it, delete the following tiddler:  [[$:/config/EditorTypeMappings/text/vnd.tiddlywiki]] .
